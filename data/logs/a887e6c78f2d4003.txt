--- Round 1 --- 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Ambassador, Duke, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke and want to increase my coin count to prepare for future actions. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take 3 coins from the treasury. I am claiming the Duke. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no information to suggest that Player 1 is bluffing, and it's too early in the game to risk losing a card on a speculative challenge. I will observe their actions for now. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): It's the very first action of the game, and with no prior information on bluffing patterns, I'm making a calculated risk based on the probabilities. There's a higher chance you don't have the Duke than you do. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no information to suggest Player 1 is bluffing, and losing a card this early in the game would put me at a significant disadvantage. While Player 1 gaining 3 coins is not ideal, it is a less severe outcome than me losing a card if my challenge is incorrect. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I do not have enough information to confidently challenge at this stage. While I possess a Duke, there are two other Dukes that Player 1 could legitimately hold. The risk of losing a card this early in the game is too high, and I'd rather not put myself at a disadvantage without stronger evidence of a bluff. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have a Duke in my hand, so it's quite possible that Player1 also has one of the remaining Dukes. Challenging now carries a significant risk of losing one of my own cards if they are telling the truth, which would put me at a disadvantage early in the game. I prefer to conserve my cards. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'm challenging your Duke claim, player1.

Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) has cards: Ambassador, Duke 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) reveals Duke! Challenge failed. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I am choosing to keep my Contessa to protect myself from assassination, especially since player1 now has enough coins to perform one. Losing the Captain means I forgo the ability to steal, but maintaining a defensive option against a high-cost action like assassination is more critical at this moment. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Given the situation, I'll discard my Captain. I need to keep my options open for defense. 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) loses a card: Captain

Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Contessa, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, so I need to play it safe and avoid any actions that could lead to a challenge. Taking income guarantees 1 coin, allowing me to slowly build up my funds without risk. Bluffing or taking Foreign Aid (which could be blocked by player1's Duke) is too risky at this stage. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll take a safe income this turn.

Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Ambassador, Duke, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke card, so I can legitimately claim the Tax action to gain 3 coins. This will bring my total coins to 5, putting me in a strong financial position for future turns. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will claim the Duke and take 3 coins. 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and if I challenge and fail, I will be eliminated from the game. There is no strong evidence to suggest player3 is bluffing, as a Duke was recently returned to the deck by player1, making it plausible for another player to have drawn it. The risk of elimination outweighs the potential reward of player3 losing a card. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have a Duke myself, and a Duke was recently revealed and returned to the deck by Player1. This makes it plausible Player3 could have drawn a Duke. Challenging would be too risky, as losing a card would put me in a very vulnerable position with only one card remaining. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will not challenge Player3's Duke claim. While taking 3 coins is not ideal, I risk losing one of my own cards if they genuinely have the Duke. Given that a Duke was just revealed and shuffled back into the deck, it's plausible they could have one. I prefer to keep my current cards (Ambassador and Contessa) and maintain my influence. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): A Duke was recently revealed by player1 and then shuffled back into the deck. This increases the likelihood that player3 might genuinely have a Duke, or that another Duke is in play. I don't want to risk losing one of my own cards at this stage, especially with the possibility of a Coup or Assassination in future turns. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 already revealed a Duke which was then reshuffled into the deck. This means all three Duke cards are now randomly distributed among the players and the deck. The probability of Player3 *not* holding a Duke is slightly higher than them holding one, making a challenge statistically favorable. If successful, this would significantly weaken Player3. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'm challenging your Duke claim, player3.

💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Assassin cards and must lose one. Losing one still leaves me with an Assassin, allowing me to maintain the option to assassinate later in the game. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Well, it seems I'm quite predictable. I have to lose an Assassin, but I still have one left. 
Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) loses a card: Assassin

Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Duke, Assassin, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke card and need to accumulate coins quickly to progress towards eliminating opponents. Using Tax is the most efficient way to gain coins given my current hand. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take 3 coins from the treasury. I am claiming the Duke. 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two Duke claims have already been successful in this game. Given that there are only three Dukes in total, the probability of Player4 also having a Duke is high. I only have one card left, and failing this challenge would eliminate me from the game. The risk outweighs the reward. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two Duke cards have already been revealed and are with Player1 and Player3. This means there is only one Duke card remaining. It is highly probable that Player4 possesses this last Duke card. Challenging would be a high-risk move for me, as I only have two cards, and losing one would put me at a significant disadvantage. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two previous Duke claims by other players were successfully defended, with the Duke being revealed and then shuffled back into the deck. This suggests that the Duke is still in circulation and can be legitimately drawn. Challenging Player4 carries a high risk of failure, which would result in me losing one of my two influence cards (Ambassador or Contessa). The benefit of a successful challenge (Player4 losing a card) does not outweigh the significant risk to my own influence, especially since Player4 gaining 3 coins is not an immediate threat. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two Duke cards have already been confirmed to be in the hands of player1 and player3 after successful challenges. This means there is only one Duke card remaining in the game. It is plausible that player4 holds this last Duke. Given that I have only one card left (Assassin) and would be eliminated if I fail this challenge, the risk of challenging is too high. Therefore, I will not challenge. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two Duke claims have already been successfully made in this game (by player1 and myself), and the cards were returned to the deck. While it's possible player4 is bluffing, there's also a chance they legitimately have a Duke. Given that two players (player2 and player6) have already failed challenges and lost influence, I do not want to risk losing one of my two remaining cards, especially since gaining 3 coins for player4 is not an immediate threat to my game position. I will not challenge and conserve my influence.

Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Ambassador, Contessa, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I need to accumulate coins quickly to perform more powerful actions. Bluffing Duke is the fastest way to gain 3 coins without a target, and given the recent challenges, it seems less risky. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will claim the Duke and take 3 coins. 
Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and two previous Duke claims have been confirmed to be true. There's a high probability Player5 actually has a Duke, and I cannot afford to lose my last card and be eliminated from the game on a risky challenge. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Given that two previous Duke claims were legitimate and the Dukes were shuffled back into the deck, it's difficult to determine if Player5 is bluffing. Challenging carries a high risk of losing one of my two cards, which would put me in a very vulnerable position. The reward of Player5 losing a card does not outweigh this significant risk at this point in the game. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two Duke cards have been shuffled back into the deck during previous challenges, making it possible for player5 to have drawn one. Challenging would risk losing my own Duke, which is a valuable card, and the risk outweighs the reward in this situation. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Two Dukes have already been revealed by player1 and player3. This means there is only one Duke left in the game (either in the deck or in another player's hand). Player4 claimed Duke and was not challenged, making it highly probable they hold the last Duke. However, I cannot be 100% certain that player4 has the Duke, and thus that player5 is bluffing. As I only have one card left, the risk of challenging and losing my last influence is too high, as it would eliminate me from the game. It is not worth the gamble at this stage. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): While there have been multiple Duke claims already, the previously revealed Duke cards were shuffled back into the deck, making it possible for player5 to genuinely hold a Duke. Given that I only have two cards, the risk of losing one due to an incorrect challenge is too high, making me vulnerable for future turns. 
Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) successfully bluffed!

Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Assassin, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have 2 coins and 1 card left. Taking income is the safest way to gain coins without risking my last card, especially after just failing a challenge. This will allow me to save up for more powerful actions or use my Assassin next turn.

--- Round 2 --- 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Ambassador, Contessa, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Ambassador card, so I can use EXCHANGE without bluffing. This action allows me to improve my hand by drawing new cards, potentially getting a Duke for more income, or an Assassin/Captain for offensive plays. It is a safe and strategic move to prepare for future turns. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will use my Ambassador to exchange cards. I am looking to improve my hand for future plays. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: EXCHANGE 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left (Contessa), and if I challenge and fail, I will be eliminated from the game. There is no strong evidence to suggest player1 is bluffing, as no Ambassadors have been revealed yet. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and if I challenge and fail, I will be eliminated from the game. There is no strong evidence to suggest player1 is bluffing, and Ambassador is a reasonable card to claim at this stage. I need to play it safe and survive. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 successfully defended a Duke claim earlier, suggesting they might be playing honestly or are good at bluffing. There are still three Ambassadors in the deck, so the probability of Player1 having one is reasonable. Challenging carries a high risk for me, as losing one of my two cards (Duke or Assassin) would make me very vulnerable. The benefit of Player1 losing a card is not worth the risk to my own influence at this moment, as an Ambassador exchange is not a direct threat to me. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no strong reason to believe player1 is bluffing. They successfully defended a Duke claim earlier, and it's plausible they have an Ambassador, especially since I hold one myself. The risk of losing one of my own cards outweighs the potential reward of forcing player1 to lose a card, especially since exchange doesn't directly harm me. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has already proven a character claim (Duke) once, which suggests they might be telling the truth again. While I have an Ambassador myself, there are still two other Ambassadors that could be in the deck or in player1's hand. The risk of losing one of my own cards if I'm wrong is too high, as it would leave me vulnerable with only one card. The Exchange action doesn't directly harm me, so it's safer to let it pass and maintain my two cards. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I am choosing to keep both Duke cards. My primary goal is to rapidly accumulate coins to perform a Coup. Having two Dukes provides a strong and reliable source of income through the Tax action, and also provides a backup in case one is challenged. This strategy prioritizes a swift path to victory. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I've made my decision to focus on my treasury. You'll see what I mean soon enough.

Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Contessa, Coins: 3 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have only one card left (Contessa) and 3 coins. Taking Income is the safest way to accumulate coins without risking my last card. I need to build up my treasury to perform a Coup later in the game. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a safe income this turn to build up my treasury.

Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Ambassador, Captain, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Captain and want to build up my treasury to perform a Coup. Stealing from player2 will give me enough coins for a Coup next turn, and they are already low on influence. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will use my Captain to steal 2 coins from player2. I need to build up my treasury. 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: STEAL -> Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left (Assassin). If I challenge and player3 has the Captain, I will lose my last influence and be out of the game. There are still two Captains unaccounted for, so it's quite possible player3 has one. The risk of being eliminated outweighs the potential reward of player3 losing an influence. I need to preserve my influence to stay in the game. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and if I challenge and am wrong, I will be eliminated from the game. It's too risky, especially since there are still two Captains unaccounted for, meaning Player3 could legitimately have one. Losing 2 coins is preferable to being knocked out. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 successfully defended a previous claim (Duke), which suggests they might genuinely possess the Captain now. Given that there are still two Captains unrevealed in the game, the risk of challenging and losing one of my own cards outweighs the potential benefit of them losing a card. I need to preserve my influence. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 successfully defended a Duke claim earlier. While it's possible they have a Captain as well, with one Captain already out of play from player2, I'm going to challenge this claim. I believe it's a bluff, and I want to prevent player3 from gaining enough coins to immediately launch a Coup. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 has demonstrated in the past that they possess the cards they claim, making it a high-risk challenge for me. Losing one of my cards would put me at a significant disadvantage, and I need to preserve my influence for future plays. There are still two Captains unaccounted for in the deck or other players' hands, so it's plausible player3 has one. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'm challenging your Captain claim, player3. Let's see if you truly have it. 
Challenge! Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) challenges Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
Resolving challenge: Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) challenges Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) over Captain 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) has cards: Ambassador, Captain 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) reveals Captain! Challenge failed. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I want to keep my Assassin to maintain an offensive threat, especially against players with fewer cards. Losing the Duke means I lose a strong income source, but I can still gain coins through income to fund assassinations or a coup. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll discard my Duke. I need to keep my options open for more aggressive plays later on. 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) loses a card: Duke 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I need to protect my coins, and given the recent failed challenges, I believe this is a low-risk block. I am claiming Captain. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll block that steal. I have a Captain. 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Captain 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 previously lost their Captain, so they cannot possibly have a Captain to block the steal. This is a clear bluff. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 previously lost their Captain. It is impossible for them to have a Captain now to block the steal. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 previously lost their Captain. It is impossible for them to have a Captain to block with. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 has already lost a Captain earlier in the game. It is highly improbable for them to have another Captain to block the steal, making this claim almost certainly a bluff. Challenging them will likely result in them losing another influence. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 previously lost a Captain. While it's possible they drew another or had two, it makes their current claim of having a Captain highly suspicious, especially as it's their last card. Challenging here has a high reward (eliminating player2) if they are bluffing, and the game history of their lost card makes it a calculated risk worth taking.

Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Assassin, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player6 has only one card left. Using Assassinate on them gives me a chance to eliminate a player from the game, reducing the number of opponents. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player6, I'm going to use my Assassin on you. You're already down to your last card. 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: ASSASSINATE -> Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player4 only has one card left. If they are bluffing about having an Assassin, they will be eliminated. This is a high-reward challenge. While there are still two Assassins in play, player4's willingness to bluff has been demonstrated (challenging player3 and losing their Duke). 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have a Contessa, which allows me to block the assassination. It's safer to use my Contessa to block rather than risk losing one of my own cards by challenging, especially since player4 might actually have the Assassin. If I challenge and fail, I lose a card, and player4's action would still proceed against player6 anyway. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I am down to my last card. If I do not challenge, I will be eliminated. If I challenge and am wrong, I will also be eliminated. Therefore, there is no downside to challenging, and a potential upside if player4 is bluffing, as it would eliminate them instead of me. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player 4 only has one card left, and one Assassin has already been revealed. The chances of them holding an Assassin are relatively low. Given their desperate situation, this could be a bluff, and I want to take the opportunity to eliminate a player. 
Multiple challengers: Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash). Randomly selecting one. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player 4, I'm challenging your Assassin claim. Let's see if you truly have it.

Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) has cards: Assassin 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) reveals Assassin! Challenge failed. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Ambassador cards, so losing one still leaves me with the ability to use the Ambassador action in the future. This is the least impactful card to lose at this moment. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll discard an Ambassador. I have another one, so I can still use its ability later. 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) loses a card: Ambassador 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I must block to avoid elimination. There's a chance my bluff won't be challenged. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll block that assassination with my Contessa. 
Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Contessa 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and I just lost an Ambassador by challenging player4. Challenging Player 6 and being wrong would eliminate me from the game. While Player 6 is also on their last card, I don't have enough information to be confident they are bluffing. It's too risky to challenge at this point. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player 6 is down to their last card and needs this block to survive. It's highly unlikely they would bluff in such a critical situation, as failing the challenge would lead to their elimination. Also, two Contessas are already accounted for (one lost by Player 2, one in my hand), meaning only one Contessa remains in play or the deck. While it's possible Player 6 holds it, the risk of me losing a card if I'm wrong outweighs the reward of eliminating them, given their desperate state suggests a legitimate claim. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player 6 is on their last card. While they have shown to be a careful player, they might be bluffing out of desperation to stay in the game. The reward of eliminating them outweighs the risk of losing one of my Dukes, as I have another one. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player6 has only one card left. If they are bluffing about having the Contessa, my assassination will succeed anyway, and they will be eliminated without me having to risk my own last influence. If they are not bluffing and truly have the Contessa, challenging them would lead to my own elimination, which is a risk I don't need to take at this stage. It's safer to not challenge and preserve my last card.

Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Ambassador, Contessa, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 has 7 coins and only 1 card, making them a prime target for a Coup. Bluffing Tax will allow me to get enough coins to Coup them this turn. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will claim the Duke and take 3 coins. I need to build up my treasury.

💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and if I challenge and fail, I will be eliminated. While it's possible player5 is bluffing, there are still two Dukes potentially in the deck or in other players' hands. The risk of elimination is too high for this challenge.

While losing the Ambassador limits my ability to exchange cards for better income-generating options, my priority is to stay in the game.

--- Round 3 --- 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Duke, Duke, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Duke cards, so claiming Duke for TAX is legitimate and will give me 3 coins, bringing my total to 8. This sets me up to perform a Coup on my next turn. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take 3 coins from the treasury. I am claiming the Duke. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 successfully claimed Duke earlier in the game and recently used an Exchange action, which means they could have acquired a Duke. I only have one card remaining, and a failed challenge would lead to my elimination. The risk of challenging outweighs the reward of preventing Player1 from gaining 3 coins, especially since Player1's claim is plausible. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and challenging and failing would lead to my elimination. Player1 has successfully claimed the Duke before, making it a risky challenge to assume they are bluffing, even though they shuffled their card. The risk of losing is too high. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): All three Duke cards have been accounted for. One Duke was discarded by me earlier in the game. Two other Dukes were revealed by player1 and player3 respectively, and then shuffled back into the deck. This means there are no Dukes left for player1 to hold, making their claim impossible.
