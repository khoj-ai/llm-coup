--- Round 1 --- 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Captain, Assassin, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Captain card, allowing me to legitimately steal 2 coins. This will increase my coin count to 4, setting me up to use my Assassin card on the next turn. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll take some coins from player2. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: STEAL -> Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): It's too early in the game, and I don't have enough information to make an informed challenge. Challenging now would be a pure gamble, and losing a card at this stage would put me at a significant disadvantage. I'll conserve my cards and observe for more information. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I can block the STEAL action with my Ambassador, which is a safer option than challenging and potentially losing a card if Player1 does have the Captain. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Captains, meaning there's only one Captain left in the deck. While this makes it likely Player1 is bluffing, the risk of losing one of my own Captains if I'm wrong is too high. Player2, the target, will have an opportunity to block the steal with a Captain or Ambassador, and I'd rather preserve my strong hand of two Captains. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no information to suggest player1 is bluffing, and it's too early in the game to take a blind gamble that could cost me a valuable card. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): It's the first action of the game, and there's no information to suggest Player1 is bluffing. Challenging now would be a pure gamble with a high risk of losing one of my own cards if I'm incorrect. Conserving cards is crucial at this early stage. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I want to prevent player1 from stealing my coins, as losing them would put me at a significant disadvantage early in the game. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I block that steal. 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Captain 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): It's too early in the game to challenge without any information about player2's hand or bluffing patterns. Since no cards have been revealed, there's a high chance player2 genuinely has a Captain. The risk of losing a card outweighs the reward at this stage. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): It's early in the game, and no cards have been revealed yet. I have no information to suggest Player2 is bluffing, and challenging without cause carries the risk of losing one of my own cards if they genuinely have the Captain. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): It's too early in the game to take such a high-risk gamble. No cards have been revealed yet, and there's no information to suggest Player 2 is bluffing. If I challenge and Player 2 does have the Captain, I lose a card, which would put me at a significant disadvantage so early on. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Captains in my hand, making it highly unlikely that you also have a Captain. There's only one Captain left in the game that isn't in my hand. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): The risk of losing one of my two cards is too high, even if player2 might be bluffing. I will preserve my cards rather than risk a challenge. 
Challenge! Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) challenges Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
Resolving challenge: Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) challenges Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) over Captain 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) has cards: Contessa, Contessa 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) does not have Captain! Challenge successful. 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Contessa cards, so losing one still leaves me with a Contessa, which is a useful card to keep for blocking assassinations. Since both cards are identical, it does not matter which specific Contessa I discard. 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) loses a card: Contessa 
player2 failed to block player1 with Captain due to challenge

Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Contessa, Coins: 0 
💭 Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have 0 coins and need to accumulate money quickly to stay in the game and be able to perform stronger actions like Assassinate or Coup. Tax provides the most coins (3) without requiring a target. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a tax to build up my treasury. 
Player 2 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 just lost a Contessa and is trying to gain coins. They might be bluffing to get back into the game, and I want to take the risk to eliminate them if they don't have the Duke. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 just bluffed and lost a Contessa attempting to block a steal. They are currently at 0 coins and 1 card. It is highly probable they are bluffing again to gain coins quickly. If they do not have the Duke, they will be eliminated, which is a significant advantage. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 previously attempted a block and was successfully challenged, losing their Contessa. Given their current state of 0 coins and 1 card, they are in a desperate position, making it likely they are bluffing again to gain coins. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 was caught bluffing about having a Contessa in the previous round. Given their recent failed bluff, there is a higher probability they are bluffing again about having the Duke. Successfully challenging them would eliminate them from the game, which is a significant strategic advantage. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player2 just lost a challenge and is down to their last card. They are desperate for coins, which increases the likelihood of a bluff. While risky, eliminating a player who is already in a vulnerable position is a high reward. 
Multiple challengers: Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash). Randomly selecting one. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't think you have the Duke, player2. I challenge!

Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Captain, Captain, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have two Captain cards, so STEAL is a legitimate and safe action to gain coins. Player1 has the most coins, making them an ideal target to steal from and get closer to a Coup. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll take some coins from player1. 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: STEAL -> Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't have enough information to confidently challenge player3's STEAL action. There's no strong indication that they are bluffing, and the risk of losing one of my own cards is too high at this point in the game. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have a Captain card, so I can block player3's STEAL action myself. It's safer to block than to risk losing a card by challenging, especially since I can prevent the steal without a challenge. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't have enough information to confidently challenge player3's claim of having a Captain, and I don't want to risk losing one of my own valuable cards (Duke, Contessa) on a speculative challenge. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Based on the cards revealed so far and the distribution of remaining cards, it is slightly more probable that Player3 does not possess the Captain. Challenging offers a strategic advantage by potentially weakening a strong opponent. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't think you have the Captain, player3. I challenge! 
Challenge! Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) challenges Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
Resolving challenge: Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) challenges Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) over Captain 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) has cards: Captain, Captain 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) reveals Captain! Challenge failed. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I want to keep the Assassin hidden as it is a powerful offensive card for later in the game. Revealing the Ambassador shows I have defensive capabilities and hand improvement, which is less threatening to other players. 
Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) loses a card: Ambassador 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Captain and want to prevent player3 from stealing my coins. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I block that steal! 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Captain 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no information to suggest that player1 is bluffing, and challenging without cause carries a high risk of losing one of my own cards. It's not worth the gamble at this point. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have only one card left (Assassin), and a failed challenge would result in my elimination. There is no strong evidence to suggest that player1 is bluffing about having the Captain. While the Captain was recently revealed by player3 and shuffled back into the deck, it's still possible for player1 to have drawn it, or to have had one all along. The risk of losing my last influence is too high given the lack of concrete information to support a challenge. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Challenging carries a high risk for me, as I would lose one of my two cards if I'm wrong. Given that a Captain was just shuffled back into the deck by Player3, it's plausible that Player1 could have drawn or already possessed a Captain. There's no clear evidence of Player1 bluffing at this point, and preserving my influence is crucial. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't have strong evidence to suggest player1 is bluffing, and challenging and losing would put me at a significant disadvantage by reducing my influence.

Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Assassin, Duke, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke and need to gain coins to perform stronger actions like Assassinate or Coup later. This is a direct way to get 3 coins. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a tax to build up my treasury. 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player4 is claiming to have the Duke. All three Duke cards are still unaccounted for (none have been revealed or lost). Therefore, there's no strong reason to believe player4 is bluffing. I only have one card left, so a failed challenge would eliminate me. It's not worth the risk. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): There is no strong evidence to suggest player4 is bluffing. All three Duke cards are still unaccounted for, making it highly probable that player4 possesses one. The risk of losing one of my own cards is too high for this challenge. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have a Duke myself, and the risk of losing a card is too high if I am wrong. While it's possible player4 is bluffing, I don't want to risk being left with only one card. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): While player4 will gain a significant amount of coins, I will not challenge this action. The risk of losing one of my two cards is too high, especially since I possess a Duke myself and can use it to gain coins later if needed. I prefer to save my challenge for a more certain bluff or when I have more influence to spare.

Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Assassin, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I need more coins to use my Assassin. Foreign Aid is a good way to get coins without risking a challenge, as it can only be blocked. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll take some foreign aid to build up my treasury. 
Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: FOREIGN_AID 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I want to keep player5's coin count low, and given their previous failed challenge and current low card count, I believe they are unlikely to challenge my bluff. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I block that foreign aid. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Duke 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no strong evidence to suggest that player1 is bluffing, and I only have one card left. Challenging would put me at risk of elimination, which is too high a risk at this point. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has successfully blocked an action before, indicating they are willing to play defensively. While it's possible they are bluffing, I have no strong reason to believe they don't have the Duke. Challenging and being wrong would put me down to one card, which is a significant risk at this stage. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have a Duke in my hand, so it's less likely that Player 1 also has one, but it's certainly possible as there are two other Dukes still unaccounted for. The risk of losing a card myself if I'm wrong is too high, as I would be left with only one card, putting me in a very vulnerable position. I will not challenge at this time. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has successfully blocked an action before, indicating they may be holding strong cards or are a skilled bluffer. Challenging them and being wrong would result in me losing an influence, putting me at a significant disadvantage with only one card remaining. The risk outweighs the potential reward at this moment.

Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Duke, Contessa, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke, so I can legitimately use the Tax action to gain 3 coins. This will bring my total coins to 5, putting me closer to being able to perform a Coup on a future turn. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a tax to build up my treasury. 
Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and there is no strong indication that player6 is bluffing. All three Duke cards are still unaccounted for, so player6 could legitimately have one. The risk of being eliminated by a failed challenge is too high at this point. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): There is no strong evidence to suggest player6 is bluffing. All three Duke cards are still in play, meaning it's very possible player6 legitimately has a Duke. The risk of losing one of my two cards is too high when there's no clear indication of a bluff. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't have a strong reason to believe player6 is bluffing, and risking one of my two cards is too high a cost at this stage. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have one of the three Duke cards, meaning there are two other Dukes in play. It is entirely possible that player6 has one of them. There is no information in the game history or current state to suggest that player6 is bluffing or does not have the Duke. Challenging would be a high risk, as I would lose a card if I am wrong, and player6's action (TAX) is not significant enough to warrant such a gamble at this time.

Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Captain, Assassin, Coins: 4 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player 5 has only one card left. Assassinating them will eliminate them from the game, reducing the number of opponents. I possess the Assassin card, so I am confident in this action. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I am assassinating player 5. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: ASSASSINATE -> Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has enough coins to perform the action. No Assassin cards have been revealed yet, so it is plausible they have one. Challenging carries a high risk for me (losing a card), and I want to conserve my influence. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has successfully blocked a STEAL (implying Captain or Contessa) and a FOREIGN_AID (implying Duke). Since they only have two cards, it is impossible for them to also have an Assassin. Therefore, I believe they are bluffing. 
💭 Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has successfully blocked two previous actions, claiming different characters (Duke, and Captain/Ambassador). It is unlikely they also possess an Assassin. As I am on my last card and cannot block this action, my only chance to remain in the game is to challenge this claim. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): While player1's claim of Assassin is plausible, I believe the risk of losing one of my valuable cards (especially my Contessa, which is the last one in the game and provides a crucial defense against assassinations) outweighs the potential benefit of challenging. If I challenge and fail, I lose a card and player5 is still eliminated. If I don't challenge, player5 will be eliminated, which reduces the number of players and simplifies the game. Player5 is currently a weak player, so their elimination is not a significant negative for me. 
Multiple challengers: Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash). Randomly selecting one. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 5 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't think you have the Assassin, player1. I challenge!

Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Captain, Duke, Coins: 2 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke and need to accumulate coins to perform a Coup. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a tax to build up my treasury. 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no concrete reason to believe player3 is bluffing. There are still two Dukes unaccounted for, meaning player3 could legitimately have one. Challenging without strong evidence risks me losing one of my own cards. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3's cards were recently shuffled, so there is no strong reason to believe they are bluffing the Duke. Challenging would be a significant gamble, and I would risk losing one of my own valuable influence cards (Captain or Assassin) if they do possess the Duke. This action is not immediately threatening, and it is more strategic to preserve my influence for future critical moments. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 successfully proved they had a Captain earlier. While they could be bluffing having the Duke now, it's not an unreasonable claim for their second card. Challenging carries the risk of losing one of my own valuable cards (Assassin or Duke), and I want to preserve my influence given my strong coin position.

Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Assassin, Duke, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke card, so I can safely take 3 coins. This will give me 8 coins, allowing me to perform a Coup on my next turn to eliminate an opponent. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a tax to build up my treasury. 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have no strong evidence to suggest player4 is bluffing. Given that two Dukes are still unaccounted for (one in my hand, one potentially with player4 or in the deck), it's a high risk to challenge without more information. Losing a card if I'm wrong would put me at a disadvantage. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player4 has successfully used TAX before, suggesting they likely have the Duke. Challenging and losing would put me in a very vulnerable position with only one card remaining. While letting them gain 3 coins is not ideal, it's less risky than potentially losing an influence. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Based on the cards that have been revealed and the number of players, there is a higher probability (approximately 58%) that player4 does not have a Duke. Challenging now could significantly weaken player4, who is accumulating coins rapidly and could soon pose a major threat by performing a Coup. The risk of losing a card is outweighed by the potential reward of eliminating a strong opponent. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't think you have the Duke, player4. I challenge!

💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I need to generate coins quickly to eliminate players, and the Duke provides a more reliable and efficient income source to reach a Coup. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'm focusing on getting enough coins for a coup.

Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Duke, Contessa, Coins: 5 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have the Duke, so taking Tax is a safe way to gain 3 coins. This will give me 8 coins, allowing me to perform a Coup on my next turn. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will take a tax to build up my treasury. 
Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: TAX 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player6 has consistently used TAX, suggesting they likely have the Duke. I also had a Duke which was returned to the deck, meaning all three Dukes are still in play. Challenging carries a high risk for me, as I would lose a valuable card (Assassin or Ambassador) if I am wrong. It's not worth the gamble at this point. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Challenging player6's TAX action carries too much risk. As I only have one card left, failing the challenge would lead to my elimination. While player6 would gain coins, the immediate threat to my own game is too high to justify the gamble, especially since a Duke was recently shuffled back into the deck by player4. 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't have enough information to confidently challenge Player6's claim of having the Duke. Challenging now would be too risky given my current influence.

--- Round 3 --- 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Captain, Assassin, Coins: 1 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have 1 coin and need 3 coins for Assassinate. I have the Captain, so Stealing is a safe way to get 2 coins, bringing me to 3 coins. Player3 has only 1 card left, making them a prime target for elimination. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'll take some coins from player3. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: STEAL -> Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has successfully defended challenges in the past, suggesting they might be playing honestly. I don't want to risk losing one of my valuable cards (Assassin or Ambassador) if they do have the Captain. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I only have one card left, and challenging player1's STEAL claim carries a high risk of elimination if they actually have the Captain. Player1 has shown to be a strong player, successfully blocking actions and assassinating in previous turns. I cannot block this action with my current card (Duke), so I will take the loss of coins rather than risk losing my last influence. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 has previously shown to have the card they claim when challenged (Assassin), and has successfully blocked actions in the past (which could have been a Captain). Given this, and the high risk of losing one of my two cards if I challenge and fail, I will not challenge to conserve my influence. 
💭 Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 cannot challenge my block as they only have 1 coin. Therefore, I can safely block their steal and protect my coins. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I block that steal! 
Player 3 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Captain 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 previously lost a Captain, so they cannot have another Captain to block the steal. They only have one card left, and it cannot be a Captain. 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player3 has already lost a Captain earlier in the game. With only one card remaining, they cannot possess another Captain to block the steal. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player 3 just lost a Captain influence in the previous turn. It is highly unlikely they would have another Captain, especially with only one card remaining.

Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Assassin, Ambassador, Coins: 8 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have enough coins to perform a Coup, which is the most impactful action to eliminate an opponent's influence and cannot be blocked. Player6 also has enough coins to Coup, so Couping them first reduces a significant threat. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have enough coins to Coup, so I'm Couping player6. 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: COUP -> Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have 8 coins, which is enough to Coup any other player. The Duke's ability to gain 3 coins via Tax is less critical at this point. Player 1 has previously shown an Assassin, making it a threat. Keeping the Contessa allows me to block an Assassination attempt, which is more valuable than the Duke's tax ability given my current coin count.

--- Round 4 --- 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash)'s turn. Cards: Captain, Assassin, Coins: 3 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I have an Assassin and enough coins to eliminate a player who is down to their last card, aiming to win the game. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I'm ending this game now. Assassin on player4. 
Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) chooses: ASSASSINATE -> Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) 
💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I will be eliminated if I don't challenge, as I cannot block with Contessa and I only have one card. Player 1 recently used an Assassin and shuffled it back into the deck, making it less likely they have it again. This is my only chance to stay in the game. 
💭 Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): Player1 just successfully used an Assassin and shuffled it back into the deck. Two other Assassins have already been revealed and lost by other players. This means there is only one Assassin remaining in the deck. While it's possible Player1 drew that Assassin, the probability is low. Given the high reward of eliminating Player1 if they don't have it, I'm taking the risk. 
Multiple challengers: Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash), Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash). Randomly selecting one. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 6 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I don't think you have the Assassin, player1! You just shuffled one back in, and two are already out of play.

💭 Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I must try to survive this assassination attempt. If I don't block, I will be eliminated. 
[DISCUSSION] Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): I block that assassination! 
Player 4 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash) blocks with Contessa 
💭 Player 1 (gemini:gemini-2.5-flash): All three Contessa cards are already out of play (two lost by player2, one lost by player6). Therefore, player4 cannot possibly have a Contessa to block the assassination.
